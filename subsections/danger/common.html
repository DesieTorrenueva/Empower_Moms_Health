    During pregnancy, your body goes through many changes. While some discomforts
    are normal, certain symptoms may signal a developing complication.
    Recognizing these common warning signs allows you to seek care before
    serious problems occur.

    It is not always easy to tell the difference between normal pregnancy changes
    and warning signs. <strong>If you feel unsure or worried, always consult your
    midwife or obstetrician.</strong>
