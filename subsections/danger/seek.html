  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> Why Immediate Action Matters</h3>

  <p>
    Delaying medical care can increase the risk of complications such as
    infection, preterm birth, severe bleeding, or pregnancy loss.
    Many serious conditions can be treated effectively when identified early.
  </p>

  <p>
    Never worry about “overreacting.”
    Healthcare providers would rather assess a symptom early
    than treat a serious emergency later.
