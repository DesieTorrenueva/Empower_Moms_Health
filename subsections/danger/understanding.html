  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-lungs"></i> Shortness of Breath or Chest Pain</h3>

  <p>
    Mild breathlessness is common in later pregnancy due to pressure on the lungs.
    However, sudden or severe breathing difficulty is an emergency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chest pain, rapid breathing, or sharp pain when inhaling may indicate
    a blood clot or heart problem and requires immediate medical attention.
