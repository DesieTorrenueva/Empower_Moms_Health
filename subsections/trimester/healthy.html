  <p>
    Healthy eating during pregnancy plays a vital role in supporting both the
    mother’s well-being and the baby’s growth and development. The food a mother
    eats provides essential nutrients that help form the baby’s organs, bones,
    and immune system while also maintaining the mother’s energy and strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    A balanced and nutritious diet helps reduce the risk of pregnancy
    complications such as anemia, low birth weight, gestational diabetes, and
    fatigue. Developing good food habits throughout pregnancy creates a strong
    foundation for a healthy pregnancy and delivery.
