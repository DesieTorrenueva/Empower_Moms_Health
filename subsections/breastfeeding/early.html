  <p>
    The first hours and days after birth are a critical time for establishing
    successful breastfeeding. Early breastfeeding helps stimulate milk
    production, strengthens the bond between mother and baby, and supports
    the newborn’s adaptation to life outside the womb.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the right support and guidance, most mothers and babies can begin
    breastfeeding successfully soon after delivery.

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> Skin-to-Skin Contact</h3>

  <p>
    Skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth helps regulate the baby’s
    temperature, heart rate, and breathing. It also encourages natural
    breastfeeding instincts.

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> Early Initiation of Breastfeeding</h3>

  <p>
    Breastfeeding should begin as soon as possible, ideally within the first
    hour after birth. Early feeding helps establish a good milk supply and
    reduces breastfeeding difficulties.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Encourage breastfeeding within the first hour</li>
    <li>Newborns are often most alert during this time</li>
    <li>Early suckling stimulates colostrum production</li>
    <li>Helps reduce the risk of delayed milk supply</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-person-breastfeeding"></i> Proper Latch and Positioning</h3>

  <p>
    A proper latch is essential to ensure effective milk transfer and prevent
    nipple pain. Healthcare providers can assist mothers in finding comfortable
    positions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Baby’s mouth should cover most of the areola</li>
    <li>Mother should feel pulling, not pain</li>
    <li>Common positions include cradle, cross-cradle, and side-lying</li>
    <li>Seek help early if breastfeeding feels painful</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Early breastfeeding may take time and practice. Support from midwives,
    nurses, and family members plays a key role in helping mothers feel confident
    and comfortable during the first days.
