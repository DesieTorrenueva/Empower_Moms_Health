  <p>
    Ongoing breastfeeding support helps mothers continue breastfeeding
    successfully beyond the early days. Continuous guidance ensures that
    challenges are addressed early and that both mother and baby remain healthy.

  <p>
    Breastfeeding is a learning process that evolves as the baby grows and

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> Feeding on Demand</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feed at least 8–12 times in 24 hours</li>
    <li>Watch for hunger cues such as rooting or hand sucking</li>
    <li>Crying is a late hunger sign</li>
    <li>Frequent feeding helps maintain milk supply</li>
  </ul>
