  <p>
    Pregnancy is not only a physical journey but also an emotional and psychological one.
    Hormonal changes, physical discomfort, and life adjustments can affect a woman’s
    mental and emotional well-being at any stage of pregnancy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Providing psychological and emotional support is essential to help pregnant women
    cope with stress, anxiety, fears, and emotional changes. Good emotional health
    contributes to a healthier pregnancy, safer delivery, and better outcomes
    for both mother and baby.
