    <strong>Health assessment and monitoring</strong> are essential parts of antenatal care.
    They help healthcare providers evaluate the mother’s overall health, monitor the baby’s
    development, and detect potential risks early in pregnancy.

  <p>
    Regular assessments allow timely interventions, proper management of conditions,
    and referrals when necessary to ensure a safe pregnancy and delivery.
