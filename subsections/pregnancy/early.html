  <p>
    <strong>Early registration of pregnancy</strong> is an important first step
    in ensuring a healthy pregnancy for both the mother and the baby.
    Antenatal Care (ANC) should begin as soon as pregnancy is suspected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every woman of reproductive age is encouraged to visit a health provider
    if she believes she is pregnant. Ideally, the first antenatal visit should
    take place within the <strong>first 12 weeks of pregnancy</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if a woman registers later in pregnancy, she should still receive
    appropriate care based on her gestational age. The Department of Health (DOH)
    promotes early registration through <strong>Barangay Health Stations</strong>
    and <strong>Rural Health Units</strong>.

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-baby"></i> Pregnancy Dating and Monitoring</h3>

  <p>
    During early registration, important pregnancy details are recorded
    to guide care throughout pregnancy.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Recording the <strong>Last Menstrual Period (LMP)</strong></li>
    <li>Calculating the <strong>Expected Date of Delivery (EDD)</strong></li>

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle"></i> Building Trust and Support</h3>

  <p>
    Early registration helps build a strong relationship between the pregnant
    woman and her healthcare provider.
  </p>

  <p>
    When care begins early, women are more likely to communicate their needs,
    concerns, and preferences, which helps in planning a safe delivery and
    positive birth experience.

    before and during early pregnancy to reduce the risk of birth defects.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Take folic acid 2–3 months before conception if possible</li>
    <li>Continue folic acid during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy</li>
    <li>Recommended daily dose: <strong>400 μg taken orally</strong></li>
