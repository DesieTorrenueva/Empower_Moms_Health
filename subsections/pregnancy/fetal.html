  <p>
    <strong>Fetal well-being monitoring</strong> focuses on assessing the health,
    growth, and development of the unborn baby throughout pregnancy.
    Regular monitoring helps ensure that the baby is growing normally and
    allows early detection of potential problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Monitoring the baby’s condition is an important part of antenatal care
    and supports timely medical intervention when needed.

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-wave-square"></i> Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring</h3>

  <p>
    Listening to the baby’s heartbeat is a key indicator of fetal health.
    A normal fetal heart rate shows that the baby is receiving enough oxygen.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Heartbeat checked using a Doppler device during visits</li>
    <li>Continuous monitoring if high-risk conditions are present</li>
    <li>Electronic fetal monitoring during labor if recommended</li>
  </ul>
