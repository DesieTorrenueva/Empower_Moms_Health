  <p>
    Proper <strong>nutrition during pregnancy</strong> is essential for the health
    of both the mother and the developing baby. A balanced diet supports fetal growth,
    strengthens the mother’s body, and helps prevent complications such as anemia,
    low birth weight, and infections.

  <p>
    Nutritional care focuses on meeting increased energy and nutrient needs,
    maintaining a healthy weight, and ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals
    throughout pregnancy.
