  <p>
    Physical self-care during the postpartum period is essential for helping your
    body recover after pregnancy and childbirth. Your body has undergone significant
    changes, and allowing time for healing supports long-term health and strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recovery may take weeks or months, depending on the type of birth and individual
    health conditions. Listening to your body and following medical advice is key
    to a safe recovery.

  <h3>Rest and Sleep</h3>

    Adequate rest is vital for healing. Sleep whenever your baby sleeps and accept
    help from family or friends. Lack of sleep can slow recovery and affect mood.
