    The postpartum period involves major emotional and psychological changes.
    Along with physical recovery, caring for your mental and emotional health
    is equally important.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adjusting to motherhood, hormonal shifts, and new responsibilities can feel
    overwhelming. Understanding what is normal and when to seek help supports
    emotional well-being.

  <h3>Hormonal Changes and Baby Blues</h3>
  <p>
    After childbirth, hormone levels change rapidly. Many mothers experience mood
    swings, tearfulness, irritability, or anxiety, often called the “baby blues.”
    These feelings usually improve within two weeks.
  </p>

  <h3>Postpartum Depression</h3>
  <p>
    Postpartum depression is more serious and lasts longer than the baby blues.
    Symptoms may include persistent sadness, lack of interest in daily activities,
    difficulty bonding with the baby, or feelings of worthlessness.
  </p>

  <p>
    If symptoms last more than two weeks or worsen, seek medical or mental health
    support immediately.

  <h3>Postpartum Anxiety</h3>

    Postpartum anxiety can cause constant worry, racing thoughts, restlessness,
    or difficulty sleeping. These feelings may interfere with daily functioning
    and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

  <h3>Emotional Support and Self-Care</h3>
  <p>
    Talking to trusted family members, friends, or support groups can reduce
    feelings of isolation. Taking short breaks, practicing relaxation techniques,
    and asking for help are important parts of emotional recovery.

    Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength. Mental health support is a vital
    part of postpartum care, and early intervention leads to better outcomes for
    both mother and baby.
