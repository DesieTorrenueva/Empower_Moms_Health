  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-person-running"></i> Physical Self-Care After Childbirth</h3>
  <p>
    Physical self-care during the postpartum period plays a vital role in supporting
    your overall well-being and recovery. Caring for your body helps restore strength,
    energy, and confidence.
  </p>

  <h4>Rest and Sleep</h4>
  <p>
    Adequate rest and sleep are crucial for healing. Nap when your baby sleeps and
    ask for help from family or friends to ensure you get enough rest.
  </p>

  <h4>Balanced Nutrition</h4>
  <p>
    Eat nutritious, balanced meals including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins,
    and whole grains. Drink plenty of water and consider meal prepping or accepting
    meal support.
  </p>

  <h4>Gentle Exercise</h4>
  <p>
    Begin light activities such as walking or gentle stretching, as approved by
    your healthcare provider. Gradually increase intensity as your body heals.
  </p>

  <h4>Pelvic Floor Exercises</h4>
  <p>
    Pelvic floor exercises like Kegels help restore muscle tone and prevent
    urinary incontinence. Ask your healthcare provider for guidance.
  </p>

  <h4>Pain Management</h4>
  <p>
    If pain or discomfort persists, consult your healthcare provider for safe
    pain management options.
  </p>

  <h4>Personal Hygiene</h4>
  <p>
    Maintain good hygiene by showering regularly, changing sanitary pads often,
    and caring for wounds properly if you had a cesarean birth or perineal tears.

<!-- MENTAL & EMOTIONAL HEALTH -->

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> Mental and Emotional Well-Being</h3>
  <p>
    The postpartum period brings emotional and psychological changes. Understanding
    these changes and knowing when to seek help is essential for your well-being.
  </p>

  <h4>Hormonal Fluctuations</h4>
  <p>
    Rapid hormonal changes after childbirth may cause mood swings, irritability,
    and emotional sensitivity, commonly known as the “baby blues.” These usually
    improve within two weeks.
  </p>

  <h4>Postpartum Depression (PPD)</h4>
  <p>
    Postpartum depression is a serious condition that may include persistent sadness,
    hopelessness, sleep or appetite changes, difficulty bonding with the baby,
    or thoughts of self-harm. Seek medical help if symptoms last more than two weeks.
  </p>

  <h4>Postpartum Anxiety</h4>
  <p>
    Postpartum anxiety may involve excessive worry, racing thoughts, restlessness,
    and sleep problems. If anxiety interferes with daily life, consult a healthcare professional.
