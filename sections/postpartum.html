  <p>
    The <strong>postpartum period</strong>, also known as the fourth trimester,
    begins after childbirth and usually lasts up to six weeks, though recovery
    can continue beyond this time. During this period, your body goes through
    many physical changes while you adjust emotionally and mentally to caring
    for a newborn.
  </p>

  <p>
    Proper postpartum care is essential to support healing, prevent complications,
    and promote overall well-being. It is a time when mothers need rest, support,
    and medical follow-up to ensure a safe and healthy recovery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Postpartum care focuses on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Physical recovery after childbirth</li>
    <li>Monitoring for postpartum complications</li>
    <li>Emotional and mental well-being</li>
    <li>Adjustment to motherhood and daily routines</li>
    <li>Building confidence in newborn care</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Every mother’s recovery is different. Some women feel well within a few weeks,
    while others may need more time and additional support. Always follow your
    healthcare provider’s advice and seek help if something does not feel right.

    Regular postpartum check-ups are important to assess healing, discuss any
    concerns, and receive guidance on family planning, nutrition, breastfeeding,
    and emotional health. Never hesitate to ask questions — postpartum care is
    just as important as prenatal care.
