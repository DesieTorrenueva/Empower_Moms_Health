    <p>
      <strong>Pregnancy</strong> is a critical period in life. When pregnant, both mother and baby
      face health risks, such as miscarriage and maternal death during pregnancy,
      as well as birth defects or congenital abnormalities in the fetus.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Antenatal care</strong> is therefore very necessary to help identify risks before
      pregnancy, during pregnancy, on the delivery date, and after delivery.
      Proper care ensures that every stage of pregnancy is safe and free from
      complications, allowing both mother and baby to receive timely treatment
      when needed.

      Pregnancy Symptoms and Signs
    </h3>

    <p>
      Pregnancy causes significant hormonal changes in the body, which can lead
      to a wide range of physical and emotional symptoms. Every pregnancy is
      different—some women experience many symptoms, while others notice only a
      few.

      Early Pregnancy Symptoms
    </h3>

    <p>Common symptoms in the early stages of pregnancy may include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Missed menstrual period</li>
      <li>Breast tenderness or enlargement</li>
      <li>Fatigue or unusual tiredness</li>
      <li>Frequent urination</li>
      <li>
        Nausea and vomiting (often called morning sickness, which may occur at any
        time of day)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These symptoms can also be caused by stress, illness, or other factors and
      do not always mean you are pregnant. If you suspect pregnancy, take a home
      pregnancy test and consult your GP for confirmation.
