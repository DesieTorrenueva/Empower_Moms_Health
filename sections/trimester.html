    Pregnancy is a time of major physical, emotional, and lifestyle changes.
    While many changes are normal and expected, taking care of your body is
    essential for the health of both the mother and the developing baby.
    Healthy habits during pregnancy help support fetal growth, strengthen
    the mother’s body, and reduce the risk of complications.

    Each trimester comes with different needs and challenges. Following healthy
    tips throughout pregnancy allows you to adjust to these changes safely
    and comfortably. Regular guidance from your midwife, doctor, or healthcare
    provider is important to ensure that both mother and baby remain healthy.
