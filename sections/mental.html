  <p>
    <strong>Pregnancy</strong> is a period of major emotional and psychological change.
    While many women experience happiness and excitement, it is also common
    to feel anxiety, stress, or sadness. Understanding these emotional changes
    and seeking support when needed is essential for maternal and baby well-being.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Emotional Changes:</strong> Hormonal shifts, physical changes,
      concerns about the baby, and lifestyle adjustments may cause emotions
      such as joy, anxiety, fear, or sadness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Self-Care Strategies:</strong> Practice self-care through rest,
      balanced nutrition, approved exercise, meditation, deep breathing,
      and engaging in enjoyable activities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Social Support:</strong> Talking openly with a partner, family,
      friends, or joining prenatal classes can provide reassurance and reduce
      feelings of isolation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Professional Help:</strong> If emotional distress becomes
      overwhelming or persistent, consult a healthcare provider who can
      assess your mental health and refer you to a qualified mental health
      professional.

    The postpartum period brings significant emotional adjustments as the
    body recovers and mothers adapt to caring for a newborn. Awareness of

    <li>
      <strong>Postpartum Depression:</strong> A more serious condition that
      includes persistent sadness, loss of interest, sleep or appetite changes,
      difficulty bonding with the baby, and thoughts of self-harm. Professional
      treatment is essential.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Self-Care Strategies:</strong> Prioritize rest, nutritious meals,
      gentle physical activity, relaxation techniques, and personal time to
      support emotional recovery.
