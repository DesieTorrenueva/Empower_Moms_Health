  <p>
    <strong>Breastfeeding</strong> support during pregnancy and postpartum focuses on education,
    early skin-to-skin contact, frequent feeding, proper latch techniques,
    and ongoing guidance from healthcare providers and support systems.
    This support helps mothers establish successful breastfeeding and manage
    common challenges.

<!-- GLOBAL IMPORTANCE -->
<section class="card">
  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i> Importance of Breastfeeding</h3>

  <p>
    Protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding saves more lives than
    any other preventive intervention. Exclusive and continued breastfeeding
    can prevent up to 13% of deaths among children under five globally.
  </p>

  <p>
    Breastfed children experience fewer infections, lower risk of chronic diseases,
    higher IQ scores, and improved long-term outcomes. Mothers also benefit from
    reduced health risks and financial savings.
