  <p>
    <strong>Breastfeeding</strong> is one of the most important ways to support
    your baby’s health and development. Breastfeeding support during pregnancy
    and after birth focuses on education, early skin-to-skin contact, proper
    feeding techniques, and ongoing guidance from healthcare providers and
    support systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the right preparation and support, most mothers can successfully
    breastfeed and overcome common challenges such as sore nipples, low milk
    supply, or concerns about baby’s feeding patterns.

    Breastfeeding Support During Pregnancy
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p>
      Breastfeeding preparation begins during pregnancy. Learning what to expect
      helps build confidence and reduces anxiety after delivery.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this time, mothers are encouraged to understand the benefits of
      breastfeeding for both the baby and the mother, including improved immunity,
      bonding, and faster postpartum recovery.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Education:</strong> Attend breastfeeding classes, watch instructional
        videos, or read trusted materials provided by healthcare professionals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Understanding Benefits:</strong> Learn how breast milk protects
        babies from infections and supports healthy growth and brain development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Planning Ahead:</strong> Discuss feeding plans with your partner,
        family, and healthcare provider to ensure support after birth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Addressing Concerns:</strong> Ask questions about breastfeeding
        positions, milk supply, working and breastfeeding, or breastfeeding after
        cesarean delivery.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Preparing early allows mothers to feel more confident and ready to start
      breastfeeding as soon as the baby is born.
